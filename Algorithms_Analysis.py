# Assume that an Insertion sort algorithm in the worst case takes 4 minutes and 10 seconds for an input of pool size
# 30. What will be the maximum input pool size of a problem that can be solved in 20 minutes and 50 seconds in the
# worst case?

# 4 minutes and 10 seconds = 250 seconds
# 20 minutes and 50 seconds = 1250 seconds
# 30 * 250 = 7500 seconds
# 7500 / 1250 = 6
# 30 * 6 = 180
# 180 is the maximum input pool size of a problem that can be solved in 20 minutes and 50 seconds in the
# worst case
