#A graph G is a set V(G) of vertices and a set E(G) of edges which are pairs of vertices.

v = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}

e = {('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'd'), ('d', 'e'), ('e', 'a')}

# a path of length k is a sequence v0, v1,...,vk of vertices such that (vi, vi+1) for i = 0, 1,..., k-1 
# are edges of G.
