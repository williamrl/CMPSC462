# what does a tree look like in code

# A tree is a data structure that is used to represent a hierarchical relationship between elements.
# It is a non-linear data structure that is used to represent data in a hierarchical form.
# A tree is a collection of nodes connected by edges.
# Each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes (children).
# The topmost node is called the root node.
# The nodes that have no children are called leaf nodes.
# A tree is a recursive data structure, meaning that each node is itself a tree.
# A tree can be represented in code using a class-based approach.
# Here is an example of a tree class in Python:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.children = []

    def add_child(self, child):
        self.children.append(child)

# In this code snippet, we define a TreeNode class that represents a node in a tree.
# Each node has a value and a list of children nodes.
# The add_child method is used to add a child node to the current node.
# This code snippet provides a basic representation of a tree in code.
# Trees are used in various applications such as file systems, organization charts, and decision trees.

def treeSearch(x, k):
    if x == None or x.value == k:
        return x
    for c in x.children:
        result = treeSearch(c, k)
        if result != None:
            return result
    return None

# The treeSearch function takes a TreeNode x and a value k as input and returns the node with the value k in the tree rooted at x.
# If the value k is not found in the tree, the function returns None.
# The function uses a recursive approach to search for the value k in the tree.
# It first checks if the current node x is None or if its value is equal to k.
# If either of these conditions is true, the function returns the current node x.
# Otherwise, it recursively searches for the value k in the children of the current node x.
